# jikan.net

Jikan.net is a .NET wrapper for [Jikan](https://jikan.moe) RESTful API for parsing data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.com). Main objective of the wrapper is to simplify utilization of Jikan API, as strongly typed languages are not-so-easy to use with elastic json (sure we can go use dynamics in .NET, but let's think about performance).

### Main attributes

* Written in .Net Standard 2.0, compatible with .Net Framework (4.6.1 or newer) and .Net Core (2.0 or newer).
* Fully asynchromous request fetching (can be forced to synchromous if needed).
* Can handle both SSL encrypted and non-SSL encrypted requests.
* Light on dependencies (require only Newtonsoft.Json for parsing).
* Usable with Dependency Injection.
